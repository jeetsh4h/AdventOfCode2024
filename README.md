# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2024 Solutions ðŸŽ„

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges.

## What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an annual programming event created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/). Every day from December 1st through December 25th, a new programming puzzle is released. Each puzzle has two parts, with the second part unlocking after completing the first. The puzzles can be solved in any programming language and provide a great opportunity to learn new concepts and improve problem-solving skills.

## Solutions Structure

Each day's solution is organized in its own directory (Day01, Day02, etc.) containing:
- `part_one.py`: Solution for the first puzzle
- `part_two.py`: Solution for the second puzzle
- `input.txt`: Puzzle input data
- `test_input.txt`: Example input data (from the puzzle description)

**Note**: Part two of the puzzle may have different test input than part one. Make sure to verify if a separate test input is provided for part two and adjust your solution accordingly.

## Running the Solutions

To run any solution:
```bash
python DayXX/part_one.py  # Replace XX with day number
python DayXX/part_two.py
```
